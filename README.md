# Analyze-A-B-test--DAND

Within the framework this project, we tried to understand whether the company should implement a new page or keep the old page with following:

* ***Probability based approach***
 
* ***A/B test***
 
* ***Regression approach***


#### Requirements
Python 3.6 (or higher)

matplotlib 2.1 (or higher)

numpy 1.10 (or higher)

pandas 0.20 (or higher)

statsmodels 0.8.0


#### Probability based approach:
We will try to find probability of an individual receiving the new page or an old page and what are the chances of those.

#### A/B test:
In A/B test we set up our hypothesis to test if new page results in better conversion or not

We will simulate our user groups with respect to conversions

We will find the the p_value

We will also use an alternative approach to validate / double check our results and decide whether to reject the null hypothesis

#### Regression Approach:
We shall look at exploring two possible outcomes. Whether new page is better or not.

By further adding geographic location of the users, we will attempt to find if any specific country had an impact on conversion
